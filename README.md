# Dementi-care

App folder size is too large to upload onto github. Therefore, the app will be available on the VLE page at: https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=782522&forceview=1

Over there, you will be able to find my Final Report and application zip file in the submission area.

To run, use Visual Studio Code and run an Android emulator on a virtual device such as Pixel 4 XL API 28 or iOS Simulator
